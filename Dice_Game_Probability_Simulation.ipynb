    "Liar's Dice involves two or more players requiring the ability to deceive and to detect an opponent's deception.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently learned how to play Liar's Dice and have been fascinated by the game. A large part of the game involves being able to lie and deceive other players, but having a strong hand helps to improve your odds of getting away with a lie. In Liar's Dice, each player rolls five standard six-sided dice.\n",

    "## Yahtzee Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of Yahtzee is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. In Yahtzee, each player rolls five standard six-sided dice. The dice can be rolled three times in order to obtain the best possible hand. This notebook assumes that the player is only able to roll the dice once. Therefore, the probabilities highlighted below are for the nine outcomes for one roll.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seven of the nine outcomes are the same as in Liar's Dice. However, in Yahtzee a player also gets points for rolling a Small Straight or Large Straight. The nine potential outcomes of the roll are as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "The below functions classify the hands as one of the above potential outcomes and adds one to the count of it's number of occurences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function input 'hand' is a dictionary with the number of dots on the die and the number of times that number has appeared out of the five dice. The function input 'dice_nums' are the numbers that appear on the die. This will be used for calculating a Small or Large Straight in Yahtzee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. An example of a hand is {4:3, 5:2} which would mean that out of the 5 dice rolled, 3 dice showed 4 dots, while 2 dice showed 5 dots. This outcome would be classified as a Full House. The length of the hand  measures the number of distinct die outcomes. In this example, the length of the hand is 2. For example, if the hand is {2:2, 3:2, 6:1}, the length of the hand would be 3 because there are 3 distinct die rolled. This hand would be classified as a Two Pair."
